Civitas Application User Terms

Last Updated: December 14, 2020

PLEASE READ: THESE USER TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT MAY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL
RIGHTS.

These terms and conditions (‚ÄúUser Terms‚Äù) are a legal contract between you and
Civitas Learning, Inc. (together with its affiliates, ‚ÄúCivitas‚Äù) for the
access to and use of any of Civitas‚Äô Software as a Service Applications (the
‚ÄúApplication(s)‚Äù), which include the website, software, mobile application,
product information, training programs, documentation, messages generated by
the software, and any other content. The Applications may include, but are not
limited to: Inspire, ClearScholar, and, College Scheduler. As part of these
User Terms, you agree to comply with the most recent versions of our
Acceptable Use Policy and Privacy Policy, which are incorporated by reference
into these User Terms. Other Civitas products and services, including the
Civitas website and webinars, are governed by other terms and conditions.

For the purposes of these User Terms, ‚Äúaffiliates‚Äù means any entity that
directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
with Civitas, whereby ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù (including, with correlative meaning, the
terms ‚Äúcontrolled by‚Äù and ‚Äúunder common control‚Äù) means the possession,
directly or indirectly, of the power to direct, or cause the direction of the
management and policies of such person, whether through ownership of voting
securities, by contract, or otherwise.

Civitas has separately entered into a written agreement (‚ÄúCustomer Contract‚Äù)
with an educational institution (herein referred to as ‚ÄúCustomer‚Äù) that
provided Customer with a subscription to access and configure an instance of
one or more Civitas Applications. This Customer Contract allows Customer to
designate users of its instance(s) of the Application(s). Each user invited to
access the Application(s) by Customer, including you, is an ‚ÄúAuthorized User.‚Äù
If you are accessing or using the Application(s) as part of your employment
with or as an independent contractor of Customer, these User Terms may be
superseded by the Customer Contract. For all other Authorized Users, these
User Terms shall apply. If you are unsure whether these User Terms or the
Customer Contract apply to your use of the Application(s), please contact
Customer. To the extent there is a conflict between the Customer Contract and
these User Terms, the Customer Contract shall apply.

By accessing or using the Application(s), you hereby certify that you are an
Authorized User of a Civitas Customer and are accessing or using the
Application(s) for an authorized purpose only. You further certify that you
are legally permitted to enter into this Agreement in your jurisdiction,
either on your own behalf (e.g., you are 18 years of age or older), or with
your parent or legal guardian‚Äôs consent. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE
APPLICATION(S), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE USER TERMS, INCLUDING THE
WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS, INDEMNITY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, AND ARBITRATION
PROVISIONS BELOW AND THE PRIVACY POLICY AND ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY. IF YOU DO
NOT UNDERSTAND OR AGREE TO THESE USER TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE
APPLICATION(S) AND PLEASE EXIT THE APPLICATION(S) NOW.

These User Terms including the Acceptable Use Policy and Privacy Policy may be
changed from time to time, please check these User Terms and the Acceptable
Use Policy and Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed of any changes to the
User Terms. By continuing to access or use the Application(s) following a
change in User Terms, you thereby agree to be bound by those terms. If you do
not agree with a change in the User Terms, please discontinue your access to
or use of the Application(s).

I. Authorized Use

As an Authorized User, Civitas authorizes you to access and use the
Application(s) and the Materials (defined below) only for personal
educational, non-commercial use, provided that you comply with these User
Terms, the Privacy Policy, and the Acceptable Use Policy. Civitas may revoke
your right to access and use the Application(s) or the Materials at any time
and for any reason within its sole discretion. Your right to access and use
the Application(s) will terminate at Civitas‚Äô discretion, at Customer‚Äôs
discretion (by revoking your User Account) or upon your failure to abide by
these User Terms.

You are authorized to access and/or use the Application(s) only through the
log-in credentials supplied to you by Customer (‚ÄúUser Account‚Äù) and only

your User Account for any reason, you are no longer authorized to access
and/or use the applicable Application(s). Your log-in credentials and User
Account details may not be shared with or used by anyone other than you to
access and/or use the Application(s). It is your responsibility to safeguard
your login and password credentials and immediately notify Civitas of any
unauthorized use or breach of security. You are solely responsible for any
authorized or unauthorized access to your account by any person. You agree to
bear all responsibility for the confidentiality of your password and all use,
purchases, or charges incurred from use of the Application(s) with your User
Account. Civitas has no liability or responsibility for any use of your User
Account caused by unauthorized access to or fraudulent attacks on the
Application(s) or Civitas generally.

When using the Application(s), you are prohibited from (a) using or attempting
use to spiders, robots, avatars, intelligent agents, or any other extraction,
navigation, or search tools, except for a normal browser as used by a natural

the Application(s) for the purpose of competing with Civitas or using the
Application(s) for the purposes of benchmarking or other similar purposes, (e)

Application(s), or (f) attacking the Application(s) or Civitas generally via a

ownership right to any part of that Application or any Civitas Application.
The Application(s) are the sole property of Civitas.

Customer may (or may instruct Civitas to) provision or deprovision access to
the Application(s), enable or disable certain functionalities, manage
permissions, export or download data, change settings, share information, or
delete or destroy data at its discretion. These choices or instructions may
result in loss of access, loss of use, disclosure, modification, or deletion
of certain or all Customer Data including your Content. You acknowledge that
you bear sole responsibility for adequate security, protection, and backup of
your Content. CIVITAS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN
BY CUSTOMER RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION, MODIFICATION, OR ACCESS TO CUSTOMER

your acceptance of these User Terms and will remain in effect until Customer‚Äôs
subscription for you expires or terminates, or your access to the
Application(s) has been terminated by Customer or Civitas. Civitas may suspend
your access to an Application for any reason or for no reason at our
discretion without prior advance notice. Please contact Customer if you at any
time or for any reason wish to terminate your User Account. Upon termination
of these User Terms all of your rights under these User Terms shall
immediately terminate.

Terms for cause if: (i) you violate any provision of these User Terms or
Civitas has reason to believe you have violated these User Terms, the Privacy
Policy, or the Authorized Use Policy; (ii) there is an unusual spike or
increase in your use of an Application for which there is reason to believe
such traffic or activity is fraudulent, abusive, harmful, threatening,
defamatory, offensive, and/or negatively impacting the operating capability of
an Application or Civitas generally; (iii) Civitas determines, in our sole
discretion, that allowing you to access and/or use an Application is
prohibited by applicable law, or has become impractical or unfeasible for any
legal or regulatory reason; (iv) upon request from the Customer who invited
you to use the Application(s); or (v) due to an uncured breach and/or
termination of the Customer Agreement.

Notwithstanding such termination or suspension, you will continue to be

Limitation of Liability,‚Äù ‚ÄúArbitration,‚Äù and ‚ÄúApplicable Law & Jurisdiction‚Äù

Application(s), to you or to Customer or any of our other users or customers
if not suspended, or other interruptions. Civitas shall have no liability
whatsoever for any damage, liabilities, losses (including any loss of data or
profits) or any other consequences that you may incur as a result of any such

the Privacy Policy as well as any applicable App Store rules. You acknowledge

Store from which you receive the mobile Application(s). You acknowledge that

arbitration. Judgment on an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring a lawsuit solely for
injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Application(s), or
violation of any intellectual property. Such proceedings shall be brought in
the federal or state courts in Austin, Texas.

This provision shall not apply to users in countries that require agreements
to be governed by the local laws of the user‚Äôs country.

XIV. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction

The Application(s) are tools intended for use by educational institutions and
organizations and not for consumer purposes. To the maximum extent permitted
by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply. If,
however, any consumer laws do apply and cannot otherwise be excluded, nothing
in these User Terms will restrict, exclude or modify any statutory warranties,
guarantees, rights or remedies you have.

Regardless of your state or country of residence, these User Terms shall be
governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.
Any and all claims brought under these User Terms must be initiated in state
or federal courts located in Austin, Texas. The United States Arbitration Act
shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the
arbitration clause above.

XV. Force Majeure

Neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under
these User Terms due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including
acts of war, acts of God, terrorism, earthquake, flood, embargo, riot,
sabotage, pandemic, labor shortage or dispute, governmental act, or failure of
the Internet (not resulting from the actions or omissions of Company),
provided that the delayed party: (i) gives the other party prompt notice of
such cause, and (ii) uses its reasonable commercial efforts to promptly
correct such failure or delay in performance.

XVI. Notices

All notices under the User Terms will be by email. Notices to Civitas should
be sent to legal@civitaslearning.com. A notice will be deemed to have been
duly given the day after it is sent. You agree that all notices we provide to
you via email satisfy any legal requirement that such notices be in writing or
be delivered in a particular manner. Notices under the Customer Contract will
be delivered solely to Customer in accordance with the terms of that
agreement.

XVII. Assignment

You may not assign any of your rights or delegate your obligations under these
User Terms, including the Privacy Policy and the Acceptable Use Policy,
whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior consent of
Civitas. Civitas may assign these User Terms in their entirety (including all
terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference), without your consent,
to a corporate affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition,
corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of the company‚Äôs
assets.

XVIII. Miscellaneous

These User Terms constitute the entire and only terms and conditions between
Civitas and each user of the Application(s) or the Materials relating to the
access and/or use of the Application(s) and the Materials. If any provision of
these User Terms be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable by a
court of competent jurisdiction, the validity and enforceability of any
remaining provisions will not be affected. No failure or delay by either party
in exercising any right under the User Terms, including the Privacy Policy and
the Acceptable Use Policy, will constitute a waiver of that right. No waiver
under the User Terms will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an
authorized representative of the party being deemed to have granted the
waiver. Other than the Civitas Parties, no other person or company will be a
third-party beneficiary to these User Terms.

If you have any comments or questions regarding these User Terms, or wish to
report any violation of these User Terms or applicable law, you may reach us

nondiscrimination and equal opportunity policies.

Open All Sections

## Notice of Nondiscrimination(Close this section)

### Required for University Publications

Federal laws require the University of North Dakota to include the non-
discrimination policy statement in print and online versions of University
publications that are made available to students, applicants, employees,
program participants and the public. Publications that must include this
include departmental, division, and University-wide catalogs, handbooks,
applications, magazines, newsletters, brochures, and posters.

### Notice of Non-Discrimination

The University of North Dakota (UND) is committed to the principle of equal
opportunity in education and employment. UND does not discriminate on the
basis of race, color, national origin (including limited English proficiency),
religion, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy
or pregnancy-related condition, genetic information, marital or parental
status, veteran\'s status, political belief or affiliation or any other status
protected by law. Pursuant to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,
UND does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its educational programs and
activities, employment and admission. UND will promptly and equitably
investigate reports of discrimination or harassment and take disciplinary
action as appropriate.

Retaliation in any form against a person who reports discrimination or
participates in the investigation of discrimination is strictly prohibited and
will be grounds for separate disciplinary action.

The University‚Äôs policies and procedures for complaints of discrimination or
harassment are found at:

  * Discrimination and Harassment Policy
  * Sexual Misconduct Policy
  * Title IX Sexual Misconduct Policy

### Long Form Job Announcements

For use in position advertisements and recruitment materials without
significant space limitations.

The University of North Dakota is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity
Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment
without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity, national origin, disability or other protected characteristic.
Women, minorities, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and members of
other underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Applicants

ethnicity, veteran‚Äôs status and disability status as part of the application
process. This information will remain confidential and separate from your

### Short Form Job Announcements

UND is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. Women,
minorities, people with disabilities, and veterans are strongly encouraged to
apply.

UND\'s Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement must be posted on
bulletin boards and be made available to employees, employment applicants, and
relevant subcontractors.

### Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement(Open this section)

### EEO Policy Statement

It is the policy of the University of North Dakota to provide equal employment
opportunities without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
age, disability, marital status, veteran status, sexual orientation, genetic
information or any other protected characteristic under applicable law. The
University of North Dakota will ensure that all personnel actions, including
but not limited to recruiting, hiring, training and promotion, are
administered without regard to these protected characteristics. All employment
decisions shall be based only on valid job requirements.

As a federal contractor, the University prepares an affirmative action program
as required by federal law to provide equal employment opportunity for
females, racial and ethnic minorities, protected veterans, and qualified
individuals with disabilities. UND has implemented an audit and reporting
system to measure the effectiveness of the program and maintain compliance
with its contractor obligations.

Employees and applicants shall not be subjected to harassment, intimidation,
threats, coercion or discrimination because they have (1) filed a complaint;
(2) assisted or participated in an investigation, compliance evaluation,
hearing or any other activity related to the administration of the affirmative
action provisions of any federal, state or local law requiring equal
employment opportunity; (3) opposed any act or practice made unlawful by any
federal, state or local law requiring equal opportunity; or (4) exercised any
other right protected by federal, state or local law requiring equal
opportunity.

The Equity Compliance & Education Manager has been assigned to direct the
establishment and monitor the implementation of personnel procedures to guide
our affirmative action program.

Signed EEO Policy Statement

UND must also make available the following notices to its employees and
employment applicants.

## Pay Transparency Statement(Open this section)

The University of North Dakota will not discharge or in any other manner
discriminate against employees or applicants because they have inquired about,
discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another employee or
applicant. However, employees who have access to the compensation information
of other employees or applicants as a part of their essential job functions
cannot disclose the pay of other employees or applicants to individuals who do
not otherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure
is (a) in response to a formal complaint or charge, (b) in furtherance of an
investigation, proceedings, hearing, or action, including an investigation
conducted by the employer, or (c) consistent with the University‚Äôs legal duty
to furnish information. 41 CFR 60-1.35(c)

If you have any questions or feel that you have been discriminated against,
please contact the Equal Opportunity & Title IX Office at 701.777.4171 or
